## Sentiment Analysis 
A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

The Goal: Create a Machine Learning Algorithm that can predict if a tweet is positive, neutral, or negative. In the future we could use such an algorithm to automatically read and flag tweets for an airline for a customer service agent to reach out to contact.
